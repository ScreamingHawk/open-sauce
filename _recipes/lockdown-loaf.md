Started making this loaf during the lockdown. It's a simple recipe that can be made with minimal ingredients and equipment.
It's a great way to make a fresh loaf of bread without needing to go to the shops. Perfect toasted with butter for soups.

It's also a great way to get kids involved in the kitchen.

Try with sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, or any other seeds you have in the pantry.
