"Eww that looks disgusting." -- Chloe

Yes. Yes it does. The texture is bad too. But it tastes sooooo good.

Here's the Gregg's Instant Dessert Vanilla packet.

If you can't find the Gregg's Instant Dessert Vanilla packet, you can make it from scratch with the following:

- 2 cups cream
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch (cornflour)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla essence

1. Mix the cornstarch, sugar, and salt together.
1. Pour the cream into a saucepan. Heat over medium heat until you see tiny bubbles starting to form around the edges (don't let it boil vigorously).
1. Slowly whisk the dry mixture into the warm cream. Keep whisking constantly!
1. Continue to cook over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 3–5 minutes).
1. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla.
1. Pour into bowls. Chill in the fridge for at least an hour.

In the picture, I added mini marshmallows to the top. Don't do this. If you really want at least wait until it's cold.
